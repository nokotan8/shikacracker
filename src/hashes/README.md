# Hash Implementations

This folder contains C implementations of various cryptographic and non-cryptographic hashing algorithms,
written and provided for educational purposes. While the code has been tested, it may still contain errors. These
implementations are **not** cryptographically secure and are not resistant to side-channel attacks.
They should not be used in any security-critical or production environment.
